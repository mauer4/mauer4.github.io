    summary: |
      We built a physical LED cube (8x8x8) from scratch, and created digital logic on an FPGA as a custom hardware block integrated into a NIOS softcore processor as a custom intruction. The FPGA driver was then connected to an Android app via ESP32-bluetooth, where a user can control the cube from an interface. The cube can either show cool patterns (pre-made), or open the phone's camera, point at a person, and a pose detecting algorithm creates a simulated stick person figure in real-time, transmits it to the cube where to show the person and their movement live. WON FIRST PLACE! See video.

  #   summary: |
  #     Object-oriented programming (OOP) lets you specify relationships between functions and the objects that they can act on, helping you manage complexity in your code. This is an intermediate level course, providing an introduction to OOP, using the S3 and R6 systems. S3 is a great day-to-day R programming tool that simplifies some of the functions that you write. R6 is especially useful for industry-specific analyses, working with web APIs, and building GUIs.

## About Me

I recently (December 2024) graduated from **UBC** with a BASc of Computer Engineering. Currently, I am employed as a **Digital Design Engineer** at **AMD**-Vancouver, working on designing digital hardware for their chip's  low-power high-bandwidth interconnect logic.

Ultimately, I am driven and interested in innovating and solving hard problems that can help advance our technologies. In order to innovate and actually have an impact, my sense is that one needs strong technical and theoretical foundations in a broad range of topics in **engineering and mathematics**.
